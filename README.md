Pages managed from a GridField instead of the SiteTree
======================================================

Under development: working but templates not yet fully implemented

This module manages pages in a gridfield to prevent massive sitetrees.

Full functionality depends on:
- ExcludeChildren module
- GridField-SiteTreeButtons module


## Requirements
